### Installation
Transactions app requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ installed on your local machine to run.

To get the app, you can fork the repo from https://github.com/Stephen-Shelton/C1-Node-Challenge or download the zip file.

Once you have the repo or file folder, install the dependencies and start the server:
```sh
$ cd Transactions-App
$ npm install
$ node app.js
```
If successful, you should see:
```
Server is up on port 3000
```
To use the app, go to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser and click the links to view the json data!

*Note: the json data is much easier to view if you have the JSON Viewer Chrome extension installed in your Chrome browser. To view the repo and installation instructions, go to https://github.com/tulios/json-viewer*
